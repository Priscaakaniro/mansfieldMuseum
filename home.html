        <p><b>Behind the Scenes</b> is a solution envisaged to solve the problem of showing art pieces that cannot be showcased normally in the museum.
            This website proposes a solution as to how the art pieces can be displayed on the official website of the museum to bring these pieces
            of art to life in the eyes of the visitors to the website. </p></div>
        <div class="rest"><p>
            The main pieces are shown using <b>stop motion animation</b>, which is essentially,
            a combination of photographs after moving the subject in the direction of choice. The essence is that when all these images are put together,
            it seems as though the object is making these movements without the interference of an external person.
